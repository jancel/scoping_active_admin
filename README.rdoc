== Scoping Active Admin

To install, clone this and run it with webrick if you please. 
 It's got the sqlite database in there with a abase setup.

Posts, scoped to admin user, belongs_to :category
Categories, scoped to admin user, has_many :categories

AdminUser, has_many :posts, has_many :categories

I'd really like to know if this is the intended behavior.
